<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EPDM Elastomer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Polymerization</li><li>Suspension Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EPDM elastomer market is categorized into two main types based on the polymerization process: solution polymerization and suspension polymerization. Solution polymerization involves dissolving monomers in a solvent to create the polymer, resulting in high clarity and control over molecular weight, which enhances processability. In contrast, suspension polymerization uses monomer droplets suspended in water, producing larger particles and high molecular weight, often yielding better mechanical properties. Both methods serve diverse applications in automotive, construction, and manufacturing industries.</p></p>
