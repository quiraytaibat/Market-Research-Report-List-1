<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas-Fired Electricity Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCGT</li><li>OCGT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas-fired electricity generation primarily involves two market types: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) and Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT). CCGT systems utilize both gas and steam turbines to maximize efficiency, allowing for higher energy output and lower emissions. In contrast, OCGT systems use a single gas turbine for rapid power generation, making them ideal for meeting peak demand but operating at lower efficiency. Both markets play crucial roles in providing flexible and responsive energy solutions within the grid.</p></p>
