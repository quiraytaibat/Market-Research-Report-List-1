<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waste Heat Recovery System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Steam Rankine Cycle</li><li>Organic Rankine Cycle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Waste Heat Recovery System market primarily consists of two types: the Steam Rankine Cycle (SRC) and the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The SRC utilizes high-temperature waste heat to produce steam that drives a turbine, generating electricity. Conversely, the ORC uses organic fluids with lower boiling points, enabling energy capture from lower temperature waste heat sources. Both systems enhance energy efficiency and are essential for industries aiming to reduce emissions and optimize energy use from waste heat recovery.</p></p>
