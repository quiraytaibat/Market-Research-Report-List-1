<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld VOC Gas Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The handheld VOC gas detector market is segmented into two primary types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) sensors. PID detectors utilize ultraviolet light to ionize gas molecules, enabling the detection of a wide range of volatile organic compounds with high sensitivity. In contrast, MOS sensors rely on changes in electrical conductivity when exposed to specific gases, offering cost-effectiveness and simplicity, though typically with lower sensitivity. Both types cater to environmental monitoring and industrial safety applications, addressing diverse user needs.</p></p>
